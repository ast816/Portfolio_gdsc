            <div class="main">
                <p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Node.js is a popular, lightweight web framework for beginners, and it is used by many big companies like Netflix and Uber.
                    It is an important tool for any JavaScript developer to understand</p>

                      <li>uses JavaScript on the server</li>
                      <li> runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.)</li>

                </div>
                <div class="main">
                    <p>Node.js is the greatest tool for building real-time web applications. It provides cross-platform applications which run easily on any web. So you basically donâ€™t need anything extra for running up a node application. You only need for making one. According to the Node.js Survey of users, 43% of Node.js programmers claim to use Node.js for enterprise apps. Itâ€™s a light, scalable and open-source language platform which makes it very easy to build apps even at the enterprise level also. Overall it increases the efficiency of the development process as it fills the gap between frontend and backend applications. It uses the approach of non-blocking I/O. In Non-blocking I/O approach, you can initiate a request in parallel for user2 without waiting for the response to the request for user1. The requests in Node.js can initiate in parallel. This non-blocking I/O eliminates the need for multi-threading.</p>

                      <h4> Npm (Node Package Manager)</h4>
                            <p>These are the libraries which are built by the awesome community which will solve almost all the generic problems related to the Node.js. Npm has packages which are used in our apps to make the development process faster and more efficient.</p>
                          <h4>  Node Modules</h4>
                          <p> Node.js has a set of built-in modules which can be used without any further installation. We can install some custom modules from the NPM as per the need of the application. We can also create modules of our own and use them by importing it in our apps. Basically, the Node module is a block of code which can be used again in any node.js component without impacting any other node.js component. The modules in node.js work independently without impacting the existence of any other functions.</p>

            <div class="main">
                <p>React is an open-source, component-based JavaScript library used to create quick and interactive interfaces or UI components for users for web and mobile-based applications.It is a declarative and highly accurate library that provides reusable code, which enhances the efficiency and flexibility of single-page applications. 

                    Its key features are SX and Virtual DOM, which set it apart from other JavaScript libraries. Popular companies like Facebook, TripAdvisor, and Airbnb are users of React.  </p>
                  <p><br> Key Highlights </p>  
                  <ul>
                      <li>The component-based, front-end library optimizes the page loading speed and efficiency of single-page applications.</li>

                      <li>It is used to design comfortable and interactive views for every state in the application.</li>
                      <li> It offers on-time updates that help users to receive relevant components required when data changes.</li>
                      <li>React breaks the UI into smaller individual components, enabling users to simultaneously work on each component resulting in faster app development.</li>
